# Sports Scoring App

### An app for showing teams and fixtures in a league

This is version 2.0.

I created version 1.0 using Ruby and Sinatra as my first project during week 5 of the CodeClan Professional Software Development course.

Upon completion of the course I have recreated the app using different languages and frameworks in order to further understand the implementation of functionality and design choices.

Since version 1.0 was created using a Mac I felt it would be beneficial to recreate it on Windows from scratch.

Other versions:
- Version 1.0: [Sports Scoring App - Ruby & Sinatra (created on a Mac)](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v1.0_ruby_sinatra)
- Version 3.0: [Sports Scoring App - JavaScript & Vue](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v3.0_javascript_vue)
- Version 4.0 (pending): Sports Scoring App - JavaScript & React

## Brief

### MVP:
A user should be able toâ€¦

- Create, edit and delete teams to the league
- Create, edit and delete games
- There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game
- The app should display if a game was won or lost

### Extensions:
- Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
- Self-selected extension: Add "Play a Game" functionality, i.e. the user would select two teams and the app would select a winner from these
